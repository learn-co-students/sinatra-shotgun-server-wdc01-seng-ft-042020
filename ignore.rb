You could start this web application by running rackup app.rb.





command not found
When you run shotgun from your terminal you might get a Shell error that reads something like:

$ shotgun
-bash: shotgun: command not found
That means the Shotgun gem isn't properly installed or available in your PATH. Try fixing it with:

$ gem install shotgun
If you still get that error, from within your application directory, try running:

$ bundle install
followed by

$ bundle exec shotgun
bundler error
You might get an error about bundler that will tell you to run bundle install. It'll look like this:

$ shotgun
bundler: command not found: shotgun
Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`
Just run bundle install and then shotgun again. If you still get the error, try running via:

$ bundle exec shotgun


port in use
You also might get an error about a port being in use. It'll look like this:

$ shotgun
== Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
Thin web server (v1.6.3 codename Protein Powder)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop
/Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2/gems/eventmachine-1.0.8/lib/eventmachine.rb:534:in `start_tcp_server': no acceptor (port is in use or requires root privileges) (RuntimeError)
This means you have another Shotgun server running somewhere. Do you have another terminal or shell open running a web application or Shotgun? You need to find that process or tab that is running a web application using Shotgun and shut it down with CTRL+C.

You can also tell Shotgun to use a different port with the -p flag.

$ shotgun -p 4200
== Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:4200/
Thin web server (v1.6.3 codename Protein Powder)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:4200, CTRL+C to stop
You'll notice the server started on port 4200, which is hopefully unoccupied. You can supply any port number. But it's best to terminate your servers rather than creating hundreds of new ones on different ports.
